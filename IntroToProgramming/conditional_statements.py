# Conditions & Conditional Statements

# Conditions are based on if else statement & It's a boolean type. If the condition is true it will print the true value else the condition will print false

a = 2 > 3

print(a)
print(type(a))

# Function that will add any number with 5
def add_five(num):
    ans = 5 + num 
    return ans

answer = add_five(7)
print(answer)

# But in above code we can't do something like if the number is less than 10 it will add 3 and if number is more than 10 it will add 8 for that we need conditions.abs(x)


# Using variables to compare the conditions 

var_one = 1
var_two = 2

print(var_one < 1)
print(type(var_one))
